# My Improved Portfolio Page

### Background
I just recently made-over my resume and decided that my website needed a make-over as well!

### Links
Not live yet, but will eventually be deployed to:
http://www.barbarawhiting.net

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* Bootstrap (Modals and Vertical Tabs)
* Materialize (Portfolio Cards)
* Google Fonts and Google Icons
* CSS
* JavaScript (Modals and Vertical Tabs)

### What I learned

I original was going to build this new portfolio with 'vanilla' HTML & CSS, but quickly realized that this was silly and Bootstrap and Materialize have some really useful components that would help make my project better.
