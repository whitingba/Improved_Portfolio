        <h2>Barbara Whiting</h2>
        <h3>Junior Full-stack Web Development</h3>
        <p>My interest in coding came from my desire to see how things work and to build things. As an Art major my
          Freshman year of college, I remembered a project in my sixth grade math class that sparked my interest in
          Architecture and decided to try out a drafting course. The next semester I changed my major to Architecture. I
          had always loved math and Geometry was my favorite math class in school, so it was not a far stretch that I
          would love the smooth, clean lines that I made in drafting class. While life eventually took me down a
          different path, I do still have a passion for Architecture that is seen in my love for taking pictures of
          Architecture - new and old. </p>
        <p>To this day I have a hunger to design or create and my previous career in the mortgage industry was not
          scratching this itch. Plus I was no longer challenged and I felt it was time to move on to something new. I
          took a few CodeCademy classes online in HTML, CSS and Javascript and decided I wanted to learn more. Once I
          set my mind to something I need to see it through, so I enrolled in the DU Coding Bootcamp. I decided on a
          Full Stack Web Development Program to try a little of everything. I will not say this program was easy, it was
          challenging, but this was exactly what I had been looking for. I realized I found something that would easily
          keep me engaged and learning for years to come.</p>
